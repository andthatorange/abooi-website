Foobi 
Foobi combines two words : football and aboodi (my younger brother's nickname)
When i started learning front end development I asked aboodi if he wanted his own website someday and if yes what would it be about. Him being a football nerd immediately went with a football themed website. Here's a summary of what he wanted
1. A page that would lead him to all his fav footballers
2. a quick summary of each and some of their best goals.
